## 🌌 What Is Nectar?

Imagine a **vocalist’s Swiss Army knife** — but carved from obsidian and polished by AI. iZotope Nectar is not merely an effects rack; it's a **vocal ecosystem** that listens, adapts, and refines. Whether you're tracking in a bedroom studio or mixing in a Dolby Atmos room, Nectar delivers **character, clarity, and consistency** without drowning you in buried menus.

This repository provides the **complete Nectar suite** for evaluation and educational purposes. It includes the **full DSP chain**: preamp emulation, dynamic EQ, multiband compression, de-essing, reverb, delay, harmony generation, and a **machine-learning pitch corrector** that actually respects your phrasing.

## 💻 Example Console Invocation

```bash
# Load Nectar as a VST3 plugin in any DAW via command-line test host
nectar-cli --input vocal.wav --profile pop_lead.json --output processed.wav --mix 0.85
```

```bash
# Batch process multiple stems
for f in *.wav; do
  nectar-cli --input "$f" --profile default --output "processed_$f"
done
```

```bash
# Enable real-time monitoring mode (headphone out)
nectar-cli --monitor --latency zero --buffer 64 --device "ASIO Focusrite"
```

## 🔌 API Integration

### OpenAI API Companion

Nectar can export **vocal stem analysis** as structured data for OpenAI's Whisper or GPT models:

```json
POST /api/nectar/analyze
{
  "file": "vocal_stem.wav",
  "features": ["pitch_timeline", "formant_profile", "breath_locations"],
  "output_format": "json"
}
```

**Response example:**
```json
{
  "pitch_timeline": [220.0, 221.3, 218.7, ...],
  "formant_profile": { "f1": 650, "f2": 1800, "f3": 2800 },
  "breath_locations": [1.23, 4.56, 8.91]
}
```

### Claude API Integration

Send vocal characteristics directly to Claude for **creative suggestions** (arrangement, harmony, production):

```json
POST /api/claude/coach
{
  "vocal_profile": {
    "range": "alto",
    "timbre": "warm",
    "genre": "neo-soul"
  },
  "mix_context": {
    "bpm": 92,
    "key": "C minor",
    "instrumentation": ["keys", "bass", "drums"]
  }
}
```

**Claude response:**
> _"Your vocal sits nicely in the low-mids. I'd suggest a 2dB cut at 400Hz to clear space for the bass, and a 0.7ms attack on the compressor to let the breathiness through. Try layering the harmony an octave below on the chorus."_

## 🧑‍🎤 Example Processing Pipeline

A typical vocal chain using Nectar v4:

1. **Preamp** → Warm up the signal (Neve or API model)
2. **Breath Control** → Remove inhales between phrases
3. **Dynamic EQ** → Soothe harshness (3–6 kHz) without losing air
4. **Multiband Compressor** → Tame low-mid muddiness
5. **De-esser** → Reduce sibilance, but preserve clarity on bright vocals
6. **Reverb** → Plate set to 2.1s decay, pre-delay 40ms
7. **Harmony** → Two voices: third above, fifth above (MIDI triggered)
8. **Output** → Dry/wet mix at 72% wet for glue
